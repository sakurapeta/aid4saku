sth about manifesting 
first step be on yourself 
and then visualize it
hold the image and be in the emotion
and this is it. 
***
about signs and the numbers
nothing has meaning until you give it 
assign the meaning and believe it 
if you dont believe it , it means nothing about angle numbers. 
when you see signs, keep on persisting. 
do not stop persisting until you get it wholly

about self concept
-what is it
deep assumptions
about urself, how others see you
the observer collapse the reality
the observer can be anything
the reality is the byproduct of one's selfconcept
everybody is real
but they're playing a role in ur reality
everthing you believe 
affirming i am the priority, and be that priority
***
-useful affirmation just for you
starting with general affirmations. then do the specific affs

for example: 
-what is my specific desire
i want a loving and committed relationship
iwant finacial freedom
-what you really want
write down your desire base on your future
no matter how unrealistic it is, it is fine
it shouldn't come from your past
-why those things might sound impossible
write it down and ask yourself why it looks impossible
when was the first time that you thought that
when did you do not get what you want
what would you say and suggest to the old version of you, outside of your own character as a mentor. 
write it down, and that can be the suitable affirmation for you 
"it is safe for me to trust that nothing is too good to be ture. 
i can be loved perfectly in the way i want. "
that could be tailer-made affirms for you

summary: 
-if you want a loving and committed relationship, 
you have to write down how this relationship looks like 
not from the past but from the future,
no matter how unrealistic it looks like. 
-write down why it sounds impossible at the present moment
find the specific situation when you feel it
find the first time you feel it
-see yourself outside the situation and give advice
see urself objectively
just like a turst friend or a mentor.
